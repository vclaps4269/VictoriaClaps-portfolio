My name is **Victoria Claps**, and I am a second year **Pharm.D./MPH** candidate. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at Kennesaw State University.

## Research

Currently, I am not in any research lab. However, while at KSU, I investigated the potential for airport malaria in the state of Georgia as well as identified field-caught mosquitoes, reared mosquito colonies, and collected data from pollution experiments. I still have an interest in infectious disease epidemiology.

## MADA and Experience in Data Analysis

I am taking EPID 8060E to fulfill my core requirement for my epidemiology concentration. My statistics background consists of BIOS 7010E and EPID 7010E. While I have no prior coding experience, I am excited *(and a little intimidated)* by the opportunity to learn new skills and get experience using new software (e.g., Git/GitHub, Positron, R, Quarto) in this course.

## Data Analysis Website

My research lab at KSU had a special interest in arbovirology and to form mitigation strategies to prevent the spillover of arboviruses into the human population. Thus, this link is the CDC page about *Mosquito Surveillance Software* which offers downloadable tools that can be used by public health and mosquito control professionals to calculate infection rates and other surveillance data from mosquito pools.
